          <p>They first crossed paths during orientation for the Graphic Design program at Humber College. Marcio remembers seeing Michelle sitting behind him and by Michelle’s re-count she commented about him with her mom. </p>

          <p>The first day of the Graphic Design program came for both of them, and without their knowledge, would be the start of a relationship that is spanning 7 years and 5 months.</p></div>

          <h3 class="noBotSpace subHeading">The first date</h3>
          <p>Unofficially, it began circa October, 2009. It was a classmates birthday and we all decided to go to Kelsey’s for dinner. Little did Marcio and Michelle know, everyone else ate super early. Thinking nothing of it, they both decided to stay and eat dinner later. As people left, they made comments about them being out on a date. The dinner went great; they flirted with each other, enjoyed really good food and chatted about class.</p>

          <p>The following week, Michelle was talking to her friends about the whole event when her friends asked her if they were “dating”. Michelle went to ask Marcio. He was curious to hear her feelings about the matter and responded with “I don’t know are we?”. This went around a few times until Michelle got annoyed and said “I guess we are!”. This didn’t sit well with Marcio. Technically, he never asked her out, it just happened that they both wanted to have dinner at Kelsey’s instead of appetizer like everyone else. So, this long story leads us to the official date.</p>

          <p>Friday November 6, 2009 — An anniversary they celebrate to this day. It was a movie and dinner kind of date.</p>

          <p>The night started with The Princess and The Frog, a good movie, followed by a chat a Pizza Pizza and getting to know each other. They continued talking on through the TTC ride home. </p>

        <div class="small-12 medium-6 large-6 columns">
          <p>There were bumps along the way, many fights but a lot more laugher, good times and fond memories. </p>
          <h3 class="noBotSpace subHeading">The proposal</h3>
          <p>Marcio and Michelle made a tradition of going to High Park every spring. On Sunday, May 5, 2013, they went to High Park as usual. Little did Michelle know that Marcio was going to pop the question. They walked around the park looking at the beautiful cherry blossom trees that were in full bloom that year. Marcio brought Michelle up to the hill beside the waterfall, where he asked her to take some photos with his camera. When she turned back to show him her shots, he was down on one knee and said “Michelle, do you want to marry me?” Michelle’s jaw dropped and she froze. Poor Marcio was on his knee waiting for a response and asked her “Are you going to say yes or no?” Michelle’s brain came back to life and she said “Yes!”</p>

          <h3 class="noBotSpace subHeading">And so…</h3>
          <p>Four years, a month and 12 days later, after a few moves, an apartment rental and house purchase, they are finally getting married and are super excited to have you join in their special day!</p>
